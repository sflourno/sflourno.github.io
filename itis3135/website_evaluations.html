            <h3> <a href="https://www.coolmathgames.com/"> Coolmath Games Website </a> </h3>

            <p>
                This site is Coolmath games and it is a mix of educational and fun online games that are geared to challenge
                your mind through problem solving and fun.
			</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast</li>
                    <li>Repetition</li>
                    <li>Alignment</li>
                    <li>Proximity</li>
                </ul>
			<p>
                Coolmath follows Contrast by having a dark background and colorful,bright titles and outlining. It follows Repetition by having
                the same position and sizing of each game image as the same as well as the fonts being the same and cohesive. Alignment is shown by having the images of the games aligned all to
                the left of the page and the title centered. Lastly, The proximity of everyhting on the page is shown by having all the game titles/images
                in the same area as well as the header and footer properly spaced from the main.
            </p>

            <h3> <a href="https://www.lingscars.com/"> Lings Cars Website </a> </h3>

            <p>
                This website Lings Cars is a UK site to lease personal and business cars. There is an about link, a link about Ling, the owner, and
                a link for all the cars and vans that are available to lease.
			</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast</li>
                <li>Repetition</li>
                <li>Alignment</li>
                <li>Proximity</li>
            </ul>
			<p>
                The contrast in this is very overkill and does not have a cohesive theme or color scheme. There are many different colors and
                patterns being presented. For Repetition, the page has no consistency in image or text placement. The Alignment is off and
                different headings are centered, left and right aligned. For Proximity, everything is too close togehter and there is a bad text to image ratio.
            </p>
